# Gamecube controller to NES adapter (custom) firmware

This is a project to control our good old NES with a controller that came out 15 years later... (for homebrew projects that expect a gcn controller)

## Features

* Connects directly to a standard NES port.
* Supports most Gamecube controllers. Tested with normal controllers, with the white japanese imports with very long cable, with the popular Nintendo Wavebird and an Intec wireless controller.

### Wiring

* INT0 / PD2  :  NES Latch
* PC0         :  NES Data
* PC1         :  NES Clock
* PC5         : Gamecube data (external pull up to 3.3 volt required)

The circuit is powered from the NES 5 volt. An on-board step-down regulator
is required to supply 3.3 volt to the gamecube controller.

The firmware is designed to run at 12Mhz (critical timing in the gamecube
communication code). Any other frequency will required modifications
to the code.
