Issue history
---------------


(1) SUPER MARIO BROS 3 

Firmware......: v1.0
Description...: Mario sometimes jumps unexpectedly.
To reproduce..: Stay put inside a level while
holding the B button (run) and wait. The character
jumps once in a while even though A (jump) has not been
pressed.
Status........: Solved in v1.1
Technical.....: It seems this was due to jitter/delays in detecting
the clock edge. Reworked the code for better performance in that area.


(2) PAPERBOY

Firmware......: v1.0
Description...: Cannot exit pause screen.
To reproduce..: Pause during game.
Status........: Workaround in v1.1, pause screen disabled.
Technical.....: Paperboy polls the controller continuously in a loop during
the pause screen. In those conditions, the firmware has no time
to poll the gamecube controller, so the button press that would
exit the pause screen is never captured. With the current hardware,
nothing can be done but detecting the condition and stop responding
while reading the gamecube controller from time to time. This looks
like a disconnected controller to the game, and this game exists
the pause screen when you disconnect a controller. Hence, we cannot
stay in pause mode.
