----------------= Operation =----------------

---- Button mapping:

NES      Gamecube
------------------
A        A
B        B
Start    Start
Select   Z
D-Pad    D-Pad or main Joystick


---- Turbo buttons:

When the gamecube controller 'L' shoulder button is held
down, the A and B buttons become turbos.


--- Special modes:

If 'A' is held when turning on the NES, the 'auto run' mapping is 
enabled. In this mode, the analog stick will press B automatically 
above a certain threshold. Try playing Super Mario in this mode,
the only button you need to use is Jump!

If 'B' is held when turning on the NES, the gamecube joystick
will use a lower threshold (i.e. less deflection required to trigger
the corresponding D-Pad direction).


------------------= Wiring =-----------------

INT0 / PD2  :  NES Latch
PC0         :  NES Data
PC1         :  NES Clock
PC5         : Gamecube data (external pull up to 3.3 volt required)

The circuit is powered from the NES 5 volt. An on-board step-down regulator
is required to supply 3.3 volt to the gamecube controller.

The firmware is designed to run at 12Mhz (critical timing in the gamecube
communication code). Any other frequency will required modifications
to the code.
